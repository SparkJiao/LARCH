### Abstract


>  Conversational image search, a revolutionary search mode, is able to interactively induce user response to clarify their intent step by step. Several efforts have been dedicated to the conversation part, namely asking the right question at the right time towards user preference elicitation, while few studies focus on the part of image search given the well-prepared conversational query. In this paper, we work towards this untapped task. Compared to the traditional image search task, this one is much challenging due to these facts: 1) understanding complex user intent from a multimodal conversational query; 2) utilizing the multiform knowledge associated with images; and 3) enhancing image representation with distilled knowledge. To address these problems, in this paper, we present a novel contextuaL imAge seaRch sCHeme (LARCH for short), comprised of three components. In the first component, we design a multimodal hierarchical graph-based neural network to learn the conversational query embedding, for better user intent understanding. As to the second one, we devise a multi-form knowledge embedding memory network to unify heterogeneous knowledge structures into a homogeneous base that greatly facilitates relevant knowledge retrieval. In the third component, we learn the knowledge-enhanced image representation via a novel gated neural network, which selects useful knowledge from the retrieved relevant one. Extensive experiments have shown that our LARCH yields significant performance based upon an extended benchmark dataset. As a side contribution, we have released the data, codes, and parameter settings to facilitate other researchers in the conversational image search community.
